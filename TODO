# TODOs for future events

Many of these should go into issues, but we'll keep track at the top level too.

## Teaching issues

* Be more careful when transitioning from console to scripts. This is particularly
important as we're using spyder, and editing (and hence re-importing) files. Best
approach is to show the import of a script through the console, then show the import
of a file in a script, then always use scripts rather than the console from then on
(so that spyder automagically re-imports on hitting "play").
* Make more concrete exercises for the early material. The exercises created on the 
fly worked ok, but more OR motivated ones would be nice.


## Content issues

* Monte Carlo and/vs Discrete Event. Given the balance this year we went with MC.
@drvinceknight and @geraintpalmer have [`ciw`](http://ciw.readthedocs.io/) which is a
DE simulator. There's not time for both unless we significantly reduce time on `pandas`
or remove machine learning. When re-using this material, this will need checking 
and re-balancing.
* Linear Programming. The material is probably a bit (or a lot!) too much, especially
with the `pulp` install issues on Windows. This probably needs trimming.
